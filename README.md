Senior Capstone Project in Swift 3

Features:

1.Speedometer
2. Navigation to Train Station
3. Tilt Sensing
4. Battery Level Indicator

Remake of an old project from 3 years ago I made in college. Notes:

1. Use of Core Location instead of Core Motion to achieve quite accurate results.
2. Based stations on Atlanta MARTA system. Could/Should be expanded upon using a custom API. All values hard-coded which isn't a great idea for this scope.
3. Basic sensing using Core Motion.
4. Battery level is a simple animation in this project. For the real project it needed to interface with the device to pull information.
